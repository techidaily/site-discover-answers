Audible is one of the top Audiobook platforms around. It's an Amazon company, so you can be sure you’re getting quality audiobooks when you choose to download them. Audible has a large library of audiobooks for you to find, purchase, and enjoy. Some are timeless classics, while others are hot off the press. Science fiction, romance, mysteries, self-help, biographies… there's something for everyone. Besides this, you can listen to audiobooks right on Audible's website, or on Audible apps for iOS/Android. However, the disadvantages of Audible DRM protection far outweigh its advantages. So have you ever thought about removing Audible DRM in order to back up your Audible books.

### 1\. Why should You Back up Audible Books

Audible Audiobooks distributed by Audible.com are DRMed AAX files that can be only played on Audible itself, or on specific apps authorized by your Audible account. Even though you have purchased the Audible books, it doesn't mean they are totally owned by you. Due to DRM protection, you only have the right to listen to the purchased book, but you can’t have the Audible books at your disposal. For example, first and foremost, AAX is not a common audio format, like MP3\. So it's very inconvenient to play Audible AAX books on mainstream MP3 player or other music apps; Second, you can’t share your Audible books with your best friends directly or without any limitations; Third, if someday Audible.com no longer exist, so will your Audible books. Why not back up Audible books in case something bad or unexpected happens? In my opinion, it's very necessary to back up Audible books to take full control of your paid content.

Id like to add - as a long time audible user - that sometimes you will have bought a book and it simply disappears from your library. I have been downloading ALL my audibles since discovering this. You might add that to your Epubor Audible page. The books can and do disappear.

 If you get this audible file from the audible subscription service, there is will no download button.
