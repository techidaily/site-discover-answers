## How did I get infected?

Gosearches.gg is a kind of malware that could infect your system without your information or consent. There are several ways that Gosearches.gg can get into your systems.

One way is through software program downloading. Hackers frequently bundle their malware with legitimate software downloads, so it will also get into your system while installing it.
