**Tips: When you log in with Lynda Library Card Account, please log in with the following rule:**

Email: lib:LIBRARY\_CARD\_NUMBER@LIBRARY\_ID

Password: Library Card PIN 

**How to find the Library ID, LIBRARY\_CARD\_NUMBER, and Library Pin:**

As we know, to log into the library, LinkedIn requires the following three information:
* 1\. Library login URL: Different libraries use different URLs, in the log in library url, we can find the LIBRARY\_ID
* Usually, the library login url is in this format: https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/go/LIBRARY\_ID
* For example:
* If your library log in url is https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/go/dcpubliclibrary Then your LIBRARY\_ID is dcpubliclibrary
* If your library log in url is https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/go/halifaxca Then your LIBRARY\_ID is halifaxca
* If your library log in url is https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/go/ account/73722380 Then your LIBRARY\_ID is account/73722380
* 2\. LIBRARY\_CARD\_NUMBER
* 3\. LIBRARY\_PIN
