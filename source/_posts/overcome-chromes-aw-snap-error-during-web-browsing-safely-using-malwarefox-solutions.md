## Reload the Page

It is possible that while loading a specific website, your internet connection got interrupted, and the page did not load properly, causing the Aw Snap problem. You must wait for some time and try to reload the webpage. If the page loaded correctly, then you do not have to do anything else, the problem was just because of the network break.

## Try Restarting the Chrome Browser

Sometimes Chrome browser may behave abruptly because of error in add-ons or some internal bug. In this case, just restart the browser, and the problem should be solved.

## Try Restarting your PC

If this problem is continuously appearing, then maybe it is because some other application is interfering with Chrome, causing the problem. However, this does not mean that the other application is rogue. Applications may interfere with each other due to some system error. In this case, restarting your device should solve the problem.

## Close all other Tabs

If you have a lot of tabs opened on Google Chrome, it could also cause the Aw Snap error. 

The reason is that Chrome uses a lot of system RAM to run, and every opened tab would further pressurize the RAM. So, Aw Snap error is occurring because the browser is not getting enough RAM to load that page. 

To resolve it, close all other tabs, excluding the current tab, and then reload the page.

## Check Chrome for Malware

Your Chrome browser may have got attacked with malware such as browser hijacker, pop-up, adware, or other. To [remove them](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), you can either use a proper antimalware program like MalwareFox or use the inbuilt antimalware scanner of Chrome. To use Chrome antimalware scanner follow these steps:

1\. Click on the three dots icon at the top-right corner and look for **Settings** and click it.

![Chrome Settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrome-Malware-Scanner-1.png)

2\. Scroll Down and click on **Advanced**

![Chrome Advanced Options](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrome-Malware-Scanner-2.png)

3\. Again move at the bottom, and under **Reset and clean up,** you would find **Clean up computer.** Click on it.

## Open the Website in Incognito Mode

If you are facing the Aw Snap problem while browsing a particular website in the normal mode of Chrome, then try opening that website in Incognito mode. It is good if the website runs in incognito mode. However, this is not a permanent solution. You might have to remove certain extensions or create a new Chrome profile to run the website in the normal mode of Chrome. In the next solutions, you would learn how to do that.

## Disable Chrome Extensions

Recently you might have installed an extension that could also be the reason for causing the Aw Snap error. So you have to disable those extensions to solve the problem. For that, follow these steps:

1\. Open Chrome and click on the three dots icon at the top-right corner. Hover over **More tools** and then click on **Extensions.**

![Chrome Extensions Settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrome-Extensions.jpg)

2\. A collection of all the installed Extensions would be opened in a window. Look for the latest installed extensions and disable them all.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3\. Restart the Chrome browser and see if the problem solves or not. If the problem is fixed, one by one enable the extensions and check on enabling which extension, the problem returns. Permanently delete that culprit extension.

## Create a new Chrome Profile

There might be some corrupted files present on your current Chrome profile that is causing the Aw Snap. So, it is better to create a new profile. Follow these steps:

1\. Completely close the Google Chrome and make sure there is no other window of Chrome is running.

2\. Press **Windows Key + R** to open the Run Command window and type **%localappdata%** in it. Press the Enter key.

3\. Follow this path to reach Chrome user data folder: **Google-> Chrome->User Data**

4\. In the User Data folder, search for the **Default** named folder. Rename it as Backup Default.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrome-User-Data.jpg)

5\. Now restart the Chrome browser, and your new profile should have been created, and Aw Snap error must be fixed. 

You can also copy the data from the **Backup Default** to the new **Default** folder, but it is recommended not to do so because that folder contains the corrupted file or files that are causing the Aw Snap error. 

## Disable the Hardware Acceleration

Sometimes disabling the hardware acceleration can fix the Aw Snap problem. 

1\. Go to Settings by clicking on the three-dot at the top-right and choosing the **Settings** option.

## Remove Cache and Cookies

1\. Press **ctrl+H** to navigate to the history page.

2\. On the left side, click on **Clear browsing data.**
