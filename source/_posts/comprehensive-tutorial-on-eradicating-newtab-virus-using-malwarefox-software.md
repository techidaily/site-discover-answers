Newtab also contains data tracking capabilities, which is common among browser hijackers. They can track surfing activity (URLs visited, pages seen, search queries made, and so on) and extract sensitive information from it (IP addresses, geolocations, and personally identifiable details). Furthermore, browser hijacker authors monetize the collected data by sharing and/or selling it to third-party organisations (potentially, cyber criminals).

To summarise, data-tracking software can cause major privacy concerns, financial loss, and even identity theft. To protect device integrity and user privacy, any suspicious software and browser extensions/plug-ins must be removed as soon as they are discovered.

## How did NewTab Club enter my Computer?

You might be wondering how did this virus get into PC when you do not remember downloading anything like that. 

Basically, NewTab Adware is a Browser Hijacker which finds its way into Chrome extension library deceptively. It could happen by clicking on a misleading popup ad which claiming something else but ended up installing this extension. 

Also, it could have entered by the means of ‘Bundling’. It is a method of packing unwanted / malicious program with a useful software program. 

Developers know that users often skip steps and download or install things quickly. So, the “Advanced/Custom” options or other parts of these processes hide all the details of browser changes. Users accidentally give set-ups permission to change browser settings if they skip these steps.
