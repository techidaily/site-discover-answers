As an eBook reader, we may always find there are some eBooks have wrong metadata or miss some important information, especially when the book is downloaded from the internet such as torrent sites, unfortunately, it's always ePub format.

But don't worry, there are many useful tools can help us edit the epub books metadata, in this post, I will recommend you a very powerful ePub metadata editor, it's free and very easy to use.

Someone may don't know what's the meaning of metadata, in fact it's very simple, metadata is the basic information of a book, including the book title, cover, author, publisher and publish data, ISBN or ASIN number, sometimes it contains a brief introduction of the book. It helps us identify the book and manage our eBooks in an easy way.

### Step 2: Edit ePub metadata information

Once loaded the ePub books to the program, it will display the book in the main interface. 

To edit the ePub metadata, click the pencil icon to the right of the book title, it will bring you to this window:

![edit-matadata](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/edit-metadata-with-Epubor.png)

In this window, you can edit all the necessary information of the book, such as the title, author, data, identifiers (ISBN or ASIN number), language, publishers. If you like, you can also write a short introduction of the book.

You can see this book is the lack of ISBN, type the ISBN or leave it whatever you like. Perhaps you don't like the cover? Click **Replace** button to change or add a cover which you like.

### Step 3: Save the Metadata Information

After finished editing process, click "Finished" button, and the window will be close, the new metadata is just saved.

**Note:** For DRM protected ePub Books, you need to remove the DRM from ePub books first. Only by removing DRM, you are allowed to edit metadata. If you are wondering how to remove DRM from epub files, you can check this guide on [how to remove DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Well, this is about the same as Calibre...  
 I would love to have a metadata editor that can just edit the metadata and nothing else. Having my books messed up on my reader because the title is too long or in the wrong order because of the way the metadata has been used is a pain (and a lot of work to fix!)

What do you mean it's the same as Calibre? Does it create copies of books in its own library?

This software only allows you edit the metadata, not create a new copy of ebook.

 If you are looking for some software to manage your ebooks, please check Epubor eBook Manager https://www.epubor.com/ebook-manager.html. It will never let you down.

Yes, exactly. Do you think there is a need to download a 29 MB package to change a few words in an XML file?

Deceitful: claims to be free yet after downloading & installation demands payment for it to be used.

You can just close the registration windows and use the trial version. For editing metadata, it is totally free.

does the metadata persist regardless of the reader/lib app i use for my library? i ask bcz when i use certain mp3 taggers, then i open with diff music apps, some of them cant read the data, others convert to add special characters, which i hate, and others dont allow for all the fields i set up in the tagger. after about 20 years of pdfs, doc, txt, lit, mobi, epub, ect...you can imagine i dont want to have to edit the data only to find my kindle apps dont organize the library the same way my desktop apps do. tyia
