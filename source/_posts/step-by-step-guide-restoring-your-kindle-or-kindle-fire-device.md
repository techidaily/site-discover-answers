Every digital product meets glitches, to fix which a universal method is to reboot or we can say restart.

So does Kindle. Several kinds of glitches frequently happen on our Kindles like failing to connect to WiFi, screen freeze up, etc. Following are the issues which usually can be fixed up by resetting Kindle:

* 1\. Kindle locked up;
* 2\. The screen frozen;
* 3\. Kindle becomes unresponsive;
* 4\. eBooks/apps/music/videos disappeared;
* 5\. Can't connect to WiFi;
* 6\. Want to return to factory default settings;
* 7\. Or you just want to see the "Welcome Screen" by resetting Kindle.

However, resetting is the method you can always try at first to fix Kindle problems.

### How to Reset Kindle 1st Generation

![reset kindle first generation](http://www.epubor.com/images/kindle-1st-generaton.jpg)Amazon released the Kindle First Generation on November 19, 2007, for US$399\. It sold out in five and a half hours. The device remained out of stock for five months until late April 2008.

To reset your first generation Kindle, first you need to turn it off, then open the back cover and remove the battery. About 1 minute later, put the battery back to the slot and turn your Kindle on.

If the issue still happens, then you can try another method. When the Kindle is turning on, open the back cover and find the "reset button". You need to find a tiny and sharp stuff to press the button for about 30 seconds untill the 1st generation Kindle turns off.

Then your Kindle will reboot itself. You need not to do anything then but just watch it restarting.

### How to Reset Kindle 2nd Generation

![reset 2nd generation kindle](http://www.epubor.com/images/reset-kindle-2nd-generaton.jpg)

On February 10, 2009, Amazon announced the Kindle 2\. It became available for purchase on February 23, 2009\. The Kindle 2 features a text-to-speech option to read the text aloud, and 2 GB of internal memory of which 1.4 GB is user-accessible.

To reset the 2nd generation Kindle is pretty simple, just press the power button until it turns off then wait about 1 minute to let it boot up. If it doesn't turn on automatically, you can manually press the power button until it turns on.

But if you want to wipe out the user data or make it to factory defaults, then please hold the power button for 30 seconds and release it, then immediately press the home button until the screen flashes.

If everything goes well, your kindle should reboot itself to its factory defaults.

### How to Reset Kindle Keyboard (Kindle 3)

![reset kindle keyboard](http://www.epubor.com/images/reset-kindle-keyboard.jpg)

Amazon announced a new generation of the Kindle on July 28, 2010\. Though Amazon does not officially add numbers to the end of each Kindle denoting its generation, in this industry people are calling it as "K3" or the "Kindle 3".

To reset the Kindle Keyboard you just need to press the power button for 15-30 seconds and wait it to restart itself.

Then your Kindle Keyboard will back to factory defaults and that should help you solve several issues.

### How to Reset Kindle DX

![reset Kindle DX](http://www.epubor.com/images/reset-kindle-dx.jpg)

Amazon announced the Kindle DX on May 6, 2009\. This device has a larger screen than the standard Kindle and supports simple PDF files. It is marketed as more suitable for displaying newspaper and textbook content.

Until now, it is still the largest model of Kindle family.

To reset the Kindle Dx all you need to do is press the power button for 15-30 seconds and wait for the kindle to turn off and auto restart. Just like resetting the Kindle Keyboard.

Attention: Your Kindle DX would back to factory defaults after resetting, so making a backup of the contents at first is recommended.

### How to Reset Kindle Touch

To reset Kindle Touch, please press the power button for about 30 seconds untill the screen black out. Then it will reset automatically. This is to solve glitches like freeze up or lose WiFi connection.

If you want to reset Kindle Touch to factory default settings, please goto HOME (the real button) > MENU > settings > MENU > Reset to Factory Settings.

### How to Reset Kindle 5-Way Controller (Kindle/Kindle 2)

![restart kindle](http://www.epubor.com/images/reset-kindle-5-way-controller.jpg)The Kindle 5-Way Controller is the 4th & 5th generation of Kindle, some people also call it as Kindle (4th generation) or Kindle 2(5th generation, released in 2012).

Anthony, what would be the best thing to do is connect it to a computer. While it is being connected, go to it's files, "System" and place a launcher that is downloaded from the internet. Most likely, your home launcher (default kindle launcher) has been misplaced or deleted.

My screen is black, but still makes noise when I press the volume button (so I know it's on). The screen is black so I can't do a full reset. I can't seem to find answers to this.

When I try to turn on my kindle fire it gets stuck on the kindle fire screen. Ive tried the reset method several times to no avail. When I plug it in the orange charge light comes on and the screen says kindle fire. Can I remove the battery for a few minutes then replace it to reset it? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Since its out of warranty Amazon says they will replace it for a fee(psshh). Is this one salvageable?

Hi Rae,

 Unfortunately the Kindle Fire's battery can't be removed. 

 If the replacing fee is not expensive, you'd better get it replaced.

Kindle Fire First Generation. In the past, in order to delete a document or book, I would press and hold, an option would pop up to remove from device or remove from carousel. Now when I press, it immediately opens the document or book. Repeated attempts fail. what do I do????? In other words, I can press, but I can't press and hold because the thing instantly opens.

I have had a Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation for 13 months and have treated it with kid gloves. It is frozen with the "Kindle Fire" screen. Nothing that Amazon suggested in order to get it running worked, so they offered me a replacement for $79\.

I recently commented on this site that my Kindle Fire HD was frozen and nothing I did or Amazon recommended did any good. In fact they finally suggested that I good buy another one at a discounted price. Well I started with main frames in 1965, and I wasn't about to give up on the little bugger. Finally I found that if I held the power button down and toggled the volume buttons a screen came up asking me if I wanted to reboot or do a full reset to the factory settings. This kindle is only used for audio books and old TV programs for my visually handicapped daughter. So I did a full reset. It now works perfectly after I set it up as I initially did when it was brand new.

Paperwhite went to auto update ... I was not pleased but it said to not stop. For about 20-30 minutes it would act like it was rebooting and then sit on the homescreen. It keeps cycling. Clearly an issue .. tried to restart with the 30 second hold on the start button ... nope. PC can't see the paperwhite now. 

 I hate auto update and I think my Paperwhite is now just a paper weight. 

 Anyone have any idea? If I take it apart and pull battery will it factory reset?

Ugh, I’m the worst. Just bricked the Kindle Fire HD 7? (2013) 3rd Generation by trying to Debloat the apps which constantly were popping up in the background and crashing Star Wars Heroes two-three times per hour. I was side-loading those apps using “Amazon Fire Tablet Tool” from here at Rootjunky.com and now it appears to be stuck in a boot loop only displaying the "kindle fire" logo.

 Copied the files over using my regular plain old (NOT fastboot) USB cable and things sort of worked for the past month, downloading various APKs and installing from my Windows 10 Pro desktop pc. But now i’m dead in the water. Tried pressing and holding power & volume for 30-45 seconds to force a reset, but didn’t seem to cure the issue. Still stuck.

 Thanks in advance for any assistance. Just removed the back cover, but pretty much lost from here.
