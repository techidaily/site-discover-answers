One of my best friends has been reading books on his nook e-reader for a few years, but recently he got an iPad and started to think about how he could read nook books on iPad. He has a huge number of books in his nook library and wants to keep all these books on his newly-bought iPad. For new users of iPad, maybe most of you have encountered the same kind of problem. You just want to read your books preserved in other e-readers on iPad, such as nook books. Or the right book you want is only available in nook store. 

Luckily now you can have your problems solved for I'm just writing to teach you how to read nook books on iPad with easy steps.

###  Part 1: Read nook books in iBooks

The first method for reading nook books on iPad is to read nook books in iBooks which is natively supported by iPad. Nook and iBooks share the same file formats, epub and pdf, however, they are protected by different Data Rights Management(DRM). 

**For drm-free nook books**, you can simply transfer nook books to iPad through iTunes and then open them in iBooks and read them freely. 

**For drm-protected nook books**, you need to remove drm first. Here I will give detailed steps about how to read drm-protected nook books in iBooks.

#### Step 1: Convert nook books to iBooks

As nook books contain two kinds of drm, nook drm and adobe drm, you may be confused about what software should you apply to remove drm from nook books. I highly recommend [Epubor Nook Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/nook-converter/) to you because it can help you remove drm from Nook eBooks and audiobooks, and convert nook ebooks to epub and audiobooks to MP3.

#### Step 2: Transfer converted books to iBooks

**1.** Launch iTunes in your computer and then click "file" in the menu bar. Select "Add file to library". Next is to add your converted books to the iTunes library. Soon they will show up in the category "Books".

**2.** Connect your iPad with your computer and your device will be displayed on the upper right corner of iTunes. Click "Sync" button on the bottom right corner. In short time, your books will be synchronized to the iBooks of your iPad. 

The last is just to open your converted nook books in iBooks and read them.

### Part 2: Read nook books on iPad through nook app

Nook app has served as a wonderful tool to allow ebook-lovers to read nook books on tablet devices of other manufacturers. With nook app installed in tablet, such as iPad, you can buy and read nook books without limitations. The biggest advantage is that you don't need to worry about the Data Rights Management(DRM). All you need to do is just sign in with your nook account. It's so convenient, why don't you have it in your iPad? 

#### Step 1: Install barnes and noble app for iPad

Tag on the "App Store" icon and input "nook" in the search box at the upper right of your iPad screen. Then you will come to the right place to download this app to your iPad.

For iTunes in your computer, you can go to "Store", and then "App Store", type "Nook" in the search box at the top. Then you can download this barnes and noble app for iPad and then sync your ipad.

#### Step 2: Sync nook books

**1.** Open the nook app on the home screen of your iPad.

**2.** Log in with your Nook email and password.

**3.** Wait for a few seconds while your Nook home screen is loading. Soon your Nook ebook library pages will show up.

**4.** Click the "Sync" icon on the upper right. Then all your nook books will sync to this app.

After you finish these two steps, you can read your nook books on iPad through nook app freely. If you really don't want to install such reading app, you can also choose to remove drm from nook books by using All DRM Removal. 

Just as my friend said, this tool works great for him and now he can read all his nook books on his iPad.
