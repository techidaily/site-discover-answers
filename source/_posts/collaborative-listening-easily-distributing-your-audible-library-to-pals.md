Isn't that so amazing if you can share your Audible books with your friends for free? Thanks to Amazon's Household service and Audible App Send This Book function and Audible Converter which make sharing Audible books happen. So in this article, I am going to elaborate on 3 methods to share Audible books with friends.

* [Method 1 - Share Audible Books through Audible App/Website](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Method 2 - Share Audible Books via Amazon Household Sharing](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Method 3 - Remove DRM from Audible Books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

**Bonus tip**: Are you interested in sharing Kindle book? Just read [6 Methods to Share Kindle Books with Friends and Family](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Method 1 - Share Audible Books through Audible App/Website

Through the Send this Book function you can send the audiobooks in your library to friends and family. Each person shall be entitled to redeem only one free audiobook recommendation through this program. After redeeming one free audiobook, recipients must purchase or use a credit to redeem any additional audiobook recommendations.

#### 1.1 Send This Book Via Audible App

**First**, download an Audible app and log in with your Audible account. 

**Second**, tap **My Library** and all your audible books are listed there, then tap the triple dots on the right of the book and it will pop up an option window. 

![z1](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/z1.jpg)

**Third**, tap on the **Send this Book** option. 

![z2](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/z2.jpg)

**Lastly**, choose how you want to share this audible book and who you want to share it with. 

![z3](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/z3.jpg)

#### 1.2 Send This Book Via Audible On The Web

**First**, log in to your audible's account on the web and go to **Library** and select **My Book**. 

**Second**, open any audible book in your library and tap on the **Send this Book** option. 

![z4](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/z4.jpg)

**Third**, fill out the **Send this Book** form with an email address (separate multiple email addresses with commas) and tap the **Send** button. 

![z5](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/z5.jpg)

**Note**: both ways are very easy to operate. But there are still some restrictions, like you can only share a free audible book with your friends.

### Method 2 - Share Audible Books via Amazon Household Sharing

Amazon Household is a feature that allows you to share your Amazon/Audible content and your payment methods with another Amazon account, while still maintaining your own account's security and privacy.

#### 2.1 Create a Household

In order to use Family Library to share your content with another adult in your household, you must join an Amazon Household together. Members of an Amazon Household include: 

 Two adults, each with their own Amazon account. 

 Up to four children. Child profiles are created as part of an adult's account. 

 To create an Amazon Household: 

 1\. Go to **Manage Your Content and Devices** and sign in to your account. 

2\. From the **Preferences** tab, select **Households and Family Library**.

![preferences1](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/preferences1.png)

Next, select **Add Adult** under Households and Family Library. 

![add adult1](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/add-adult1.png)

3\. Have the other adult sign in to their Amazon account. 

**Note**: An Amazon account can only be shared with 1 other account at a given time. If you leave a Household you will have to wait six months to join a new one. 

#### 2.2 Share Your Content

You can start sharing content after setting up your Amazon Household and enabling Family Library. 

You can choose to share Kindle books, apps and games, and audiobooks through Family Library: 

![share content1](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/share-content1.png)

Then your selected contents will be shared with each other.

![household is sharing](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/household-is-sharing.png)

#### 2.3 Access Shared Content on Your Device or App

Once you've set up Family Library, you and the other adult in your Amazon Household will be able to see any shared Kindle books, apps, and audiobooks in the Cloud or Archived Items tab on any of the compatible Amazon devices and Kindle reading apps registered to your Amazon accounts. 

You can access content shared through Family Library on many Amazon devices and Kindle reading apps, though you may need to enable your device to view shared content from **Manage Your Content and Devices** or the Family Library settings on a compatible device first.
