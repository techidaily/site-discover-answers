Isn't that so amazing if you can share your Audible books with your friends for free? Thanks to Amazon's Household service and Audible App Send This Book function and Audible Converter which make sharing Audible books happen. So in this article, I am going to elaborate on 3 methods to share Audible books with friends.

* [Method 1 - Share Audible Books through Audible App/Website](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Method 2 - Share Audible Books via Amazon Household Sharing](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Method 3 - Remove DRM from Audible Books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

**Bonus tip**: Are you interested in sharing Kindle book? Just read [6 Methods to Share Kindle Books with Friends and Family](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Method 1 - Share Audible Books through Audible App/Website

Through the Send this Book function you can send the audiobooks in your library to friends and family. Each person shall be entitled to redeem only one free audiobook recommendation through this program. After redeeming one free audiobook, recipients must purchase or use a credit to redeem any additional audiobook recommendations.

#### 1.1 Send This Book Via Audible App

**First**, download an Audible app and log in with your Audible account. 

**Second**, tap **My Library** and all your audible books are listed there, then tap the triple dots on the right of the book and it will pop up an option window. 

![z1](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/z1.jpg)

**Third**, tap on the **Send this Book** option. 

![z2](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/z2.jpg)

**Lastly**, choose how you want to share this audible book and who you want to share it with. 

![z3](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/z3.jpg)

#### 1.2 Send This Book Via Audible On The Web

**First**, log in to your audible's account on the web and go to **Library** and select **My Book**. 

**Second**, open any audible book in your library and tap on the **Send this Book** option. 

![z4](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/z4.jpg)

**Third**, fill out the **Send this Book** form with an email address (separate multiple email addresses with commas) and tap the **Send** button. 

![z5](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/z5.jpg)

**Note**: both ways are very easy to operate. But there are still some restrictions, like you can only share a free audible book with your friends.

### Method 2 - Share Audible Books via Amazon Household Sharing

Amazon Household is a feature that allows you to share your Amazon/Audible content and your payment methods with another Amazon account, while still maintaining your own account's security and privacy.

#### 2.1 Create a Household

In order to use Family Library to share your content with another adult in your household, you must join an Amazon Household together. Members of an Amazon Household include: 

 Two adults, each with their own Amazon account. 

 Up to four children. Child profiles are created as part of an adult's account. 

 To create an Amazon Household: 

 1\. Go to **Manage Your Content and Devices** and sign in to your account. 

2\. From the **Preferences** tab, select **Households and Family Library**.

![preferences1](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/preferences1.png)

Next, select **Add Adult** under Households and Family Library. 

![add adult1](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/add-adult1.png)

3\. Have the other adult sign in to their Amazon account. 

**Note**: An Amazon account can only be shared with 1 other account at a given time. If you leave a Household you will have to wait six months to join a new one. 

#### 2.2 Share Your Content

You can start sharing content after setting up your Amazon Household and enabling Family Library. 

You can choose to share Kindle books, apps and games, and audiobooks through Family Library:

Is the sharing of Audiobooks via Amazon Household a US only feature? I'm in the UK and audiobooks doesn't appear in the list, just apps/games and eBooks :-(

God I hate Audible. Everywhere you turn they want more money and all their formats are proprietary. They're like a coin operated toilet. I'm going back to the library

If you convert an audible book to a mp3 file, do you still have the original audiobook file in your library? What if you do not like that format, how can you get the old format back?

Thank you for asking. The original format of your audible book will be in your library. We'll not change the original file but to create a new.

### Conclusion

Isn't this Audible converter the best tool to share Audible books with friends with no restrictions? With the Audible app, you can only share one free audible book with your friends. And with Amazon Household sharing, you can only share any of your content with one adult friend at a given time. If you leave a Household you will have to wait six months to join a new one. All these inconveniences waste consumers a lot of time and make the process more complicated. However, with the Audible converter, you can convert the audible book's format and strip its DRM at the same time, then you can listen to all your audible books anywhere and share them with any of your friends. It totally ups to you. Isn't this super cool? What are you waiting for? Just try the free trial now.

Is't using this converter to distribute the files illegal?? I'm not sure I like an article like this that encourages follks to perform piracy infringements. Could someone verify please?

Is the sharing of Audiobooks via Amazon Household a US only feature? I'm in the UK and audiobooks doesn't appear in the list, just apps/games and eBooks :-(

God I hate Audible. Everywhere you turn they want more money and all their formats are proprietary. They're like a coin operated toilet. I'm going back to the library

If you convert an audible book to a mp3 file, do you still have the original audiobook file in your library? What if you do not like that format, how can you get the old format back?

Thank you for asking. The original format of your audible book will be in your library. We'll not change the original file but to create a new.
