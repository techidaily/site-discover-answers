You don't need an extra app. Just go to the Kindle app on your computer, at least on a Mac, and in the Notes and Highlights panel, click Export. Forget the note export function on the Kindle itself. In my experience, that's a blind alley.

I was using clippings.io before but the export function has been failing those days. For those like me searching for a one click export solution go on kindle-highlights.net it's free.You just have to drag and drop your myclippings.txt file and it convert your highlights as a csv file. What I do after is open it with google sheet and edit the highlights as I want. Kindlemate is not bad also but I don't want to install a software
