[Convert MyMustReads content](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/20/2020 3:42:55 AM 

I'm trying to support my local independent bookstores by purchasing ebooks through them. Many of them use a system by Hummingbird Digital Media called MyMustReads. It really locks the access tightly, but I want to be able to read it on any of my devices. Do you have a solution for converting MyMustReads files? And for removing their DRM?  
 Many thanks!

[Kindle registration page stuck in eternal reload loop](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/20/2021 8:38:14 AM 

I have Windows 10\. I bought Epubor Ultimate. It told me I had to install an earlier version of the Kindle App. With Epubor's assitance, it downloaded and installed Kindle version 1.24.51068\. The app works fine UNTIL I go to register it with Amazon. It just loops the login screen over and over nonstop. The reload is so fast I can't even type a single letter.

 Suggestions? This software is useless to me unless I can get to my Kindle books I've purchased.

[Free trial?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/14/2019 3:27:54 AM 

I was looking to test the epubor product by converting an .aax file to mp3\. It only converted 10 minutes, which is understandable under a free trial basis. However, I need to know how it will parse a 10 hour audio book .aax. Will it break it up into 10 minute segments? Will it break it up into chapters as audible does? What??

I am trying the Epubor Ultimate 30 day trial with the latest Kobo Desktop app on Windows 10\. It shows the list of the Kobo books but I can't drag a book from the right to the main window. I can double-click the book but then I get a window that states 'DRM is removing, please make sure you can read the ebook on your computer at first'. This window never closes. I can read the book through the Kobo app. What am I doing wrong?

[Epubor for iPad?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 12/28/2020 5:53:36 PM 

Currently you must use the epubor converter application on a desktop (converter app isn’t compatible with iPad), correct? I purchased epubor ultimate and it’s been awesome - I convert using desktop then upload files to cloud to access on iPad (just wondered if I could further streamline by doing the actual conversion on the iPad). Thanks!

[Full content did not download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/10/2019 11:20:24 AM 

The drm removal and file conversion was successful through the kindle 1.17 software on windows 10, however half the book's content is missing, only 143 out of 300 something pages. I tried deleting and going through the process twice, into epub and pdf, nothing works.
