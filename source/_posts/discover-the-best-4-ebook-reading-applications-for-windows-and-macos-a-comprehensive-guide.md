Reading is indispensable in our daily life. Unlike reading the traditional paper book, more people prefer a so-called "mobile reading" style along with the popularity of ebook readers. These small and portable electronic devices do facilitate our reading, but for some people who don't go out often and prefer reading on a bigger screen, reading on a PC seems to be a better choice.

### 2\. [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download)

### 3\. [Kindle for PC](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp)

[Kindle for PC](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp) is the official ebook reader for Amazon Kindle books. For those who have a Kindle eReader or Kindle Fire device, it's very convenient to synchronize the reading progress to PC so that you can read your favorite e-books seamlessly. You can also organize your Kindle e-books into different customized collections.

As for the reading experience, the Kindle for PC is not as brilliant as Calibre. It just provides some general settings such as font size, background color, line width, brightness. Although with simple functions, it does have some design of humanization like you can add notes and highlights and look up words with its built-in dictionary which is very helpful in learning a foreign language.

One shortcoming of Kindle for PC which must be pointed out is that it doesn't support the EPUB file, a very popular e-book format at present. So if you have many e-books in the EPUB format, it's better to convert them into MOBI format as you can read them both on your Kindle device and Kindle for PC.

| Reader | Reader Name                   | Supported eBooks Format                               | Reasons to Select                                              | Reasons to Avoid                |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1      | Adobe Digital Editions for PC | ACSM, EPUB, PDF                                       | Must-have for online library ebooks readers                    | Can't read DRM protected eBooks |
| 2      | Calibre for PC                | EPUB, LRF, HTML, LIT, MOBI, PDF, Topaz, Text, and SNB | Supports multiple formats; Helps edit eBooks metadata          | Can't read DRM protected eBooks |
| 3      | Kindle for PC                 | Word, PDF, TXT, Images, AZW, Mobi, RTF, PRC, PSZ      | Best choice for Kindle users; Includes text-to-speech function | Can't read DRM protected eBooks |
| 4      | Epubor Reader for Windows     | EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, TXT, HTMLZ, etc.                    | Best EPUB reader for windows; User-friendly UI                 | Can't read DRM protected eBooks |

And as what this table shows, none of one eBook reader will support DRM protected eBooks, while most of eBooks we purchased from those popular ebooks stores are with drm limitation. Here comes [Epubor All DR Removal](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/drm-removal-tools/) tool, which helps DRM from Kindle/Kindle/Kobo/Nook/Google Play books.

Yes, Icecream ebook reader is missing and it is better than Adobe Digital Editions. The title of this list must be changed to "Some of the best ebooks readers for PC".

Sure would like to find a reader that would read ALL formats in one. Right now, even with conversions, I have to have several readers. Of REAL help, would be a conversion from PDF to mobi.

1\. No such readers that can help you read all formats books.

 2\. Just choose one reader you like most, then convert other formats books to this reader supported format.

 3\. You can use Epubor online converter service(free) to help you convert PDF to Mobi well.

Neither the online nor the desktop version converts pdf files. I own the desktop version and when I try to convert, all I get is a spinner saying "1 book" (for hours.)

 The online version does not indicate how to download the book after conversion (if it actually was converted). I attempted this twice, and once got a time out message, the other time not.

I am looking for an app like iBooks without the new sensor function. IBooks is removing books that I converted with epubor from my iBooks library and deleting them. Since I purchase books from multiple sources I am looking for something better. Any suggestions?
