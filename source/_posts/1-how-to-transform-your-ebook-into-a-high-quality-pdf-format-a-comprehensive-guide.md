Except the kindle device, nearly all the other ebook devices support pdf or epub format. If you convert ebook to pdf free, then you can read them on multiple devices.

Part 3: [Convert nook ebook to pdf](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

#### 1Convert kindle ebook to pdf

If you want to read kindle ebook on other e-readers such as nook, kobo, sony and iPad, then you have to convert them into epub or pdf format. This part is going to teach you to convert kindle ebook to pdf. As most kindle ebook is protected from its unique drm, the first thing you should do is to remove kindle drm, and then convert decrypted ebook to pdf format. But what software should you apply? Maybe you have no idea. Here I strongly recommend our powerful software, the [Ultimate Converter--Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) to you for it can help you decrypt ebooks within seconds and convert file format into mobi, epub and pdf in batch.You can download it with a free try.

Download the tool for free:

After you install this software, here comes to the detailed steps for you to convert kindle ebook to pdf file.

**Step 1:** If you have purchased kindle ebooks or got your ebooks on kindle, sync it to kindle for pc first. It's quite easy. Once you launch kindle for pc, your purchased amazon ebooks will snyc to it automatically. Or if the Kindle books downloaded via Kindle eink devices, just connect the Kindle to your computer via usb cable, then Epubor Ultimate will detect the Kindle books and display at the left side bar under Kindle device tab.

#### 2Convert Adobe ebook to pdf

You can read adobe ebook freely on e-reader devices which support adobe drm, such as kobo, sony and google. But if you want to read adobe ebook on your iPad, then you have to remove adobe drm.

You should register an Adobe ID before reading your adobe ebook on Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). If you don't want to register your Adobe ID, you can choose to remove adobe drm. Often Adobe ebook supports epub or pdf format. If your adobe ebook is epub format and you want to have a better reading experience or have your file printed out, you can convert adobe epub ebook to pdf and rely on our Ultimate Converter to solve your problem. I will set kobo ebook as an example. Here are the simple steps for converting kobo ebook to pdf.

**Step 1:** After you purchase your kobo ebook, you can go to "my library" to find your kobo ebook. On the right side of your book list, it shows your book is "Adobe drm epub".

#### 3Convert nook ebook to pdf

Nook ebooks are often protected from two kinds of drm, adobe drm and nook drm. If your nook ebook is protected by adobe drm, then you can read it freely on adobe digital editions (ADE) with your adobe ID or refer to part 2 to remove adobe drm. However, if your nook ebook is protected by nook drm and you intend to read them on other devices, then you should remove nook drm first. As we are thinking about converting nook ebook to pdf free, you can also consider converting the file format to pdf if your nook ebook is epub.

Just like converting kindle ebook to pdf, you can apply our Ultimate converter. The detailed converting steps are quite similar to part 1.

**Step 1:** Snyc your nook ebook to nook for pc.

![books on nook for pc](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/books-sync-to-nook-for-pc.jpg)

**Step 2:** Launch Epubor Ultimate to load your nook ebook or directly click "add" button. Then click on "User" icon-->settings-->>Nook, and then input your Nook account and password, click "OK".

**Step 3:** Choose "pdf" as the output format and then hit "convert to PDF" button. You can find your converted nook ebook by hitting "Folder" icon.
