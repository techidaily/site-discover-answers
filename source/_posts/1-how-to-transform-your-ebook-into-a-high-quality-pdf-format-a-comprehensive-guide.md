#### 2Convert Adobe ebook to pdf

You can read adobe ebook freely on e-reader devices which support adobe drm, such as kobo, sony and google. But if you want to read adobe ebook on your iPad, then you have to remove adobe drm.

You should register an Adobe ID before reading your adobe ebook on Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). If you don't want to register your Adobe ID, you can choose to remove adobe drm. Often Adobe ebook supports epub or pdf format. If your adobe ebook is epub format and you want to have a better reading experience or have your file printed out, you can convert adobe epub ebook to pdf and rely on our Ultimate Converter to solve your problem. I will set kobo ebook as an example. Here are the simple steps for converting kobo ebook to pdf.

**Step 1:** After you purchase your kobo ebook, you can go to "my library" to find your kobo ebook. On the right side of your book list, it shows your book is "Adobe drm epub".

#### 3Convert nook ebook to pdf

Nook ebooks are often protected from two kinds of drm, adobe drm and nook drm. If your nook ebook is protected by adobe drm, then you can read it freely on adobe digital editions (ADE) with your adobe ID or refer to part 2 to remove adobe drm. However, if your nook ebook is protected by nook drm and you intend to read them on other devices, then you should remove nook drm first. As we are thinking about converting nook ebook to pdf free, you can also consider converting the file format to pdf if your nook ebook is epub.

Just like converting kindle ebook to pdf, you can apply our Ultimate converter. The detailed converting steps are quite similar to part 1.

**Step 1:** Snyc your nook ebook to nook for pc.
