## How do I know my phone has an Adware?

When a biological virus enters a human body, the body will display the signs of infection through fever and other symptoms.

Similarly, after an Adware get infiltrated in your device, the device will show various signs of the attack.

Here is the list of top symptoms that will confirm the presence of an Adware on your Android phone.

1. **Ad Bombardement**: You will notice that suddenly frequency of the ads on your phone has multiplied, even though you are not browsing anything on the browser and apps are also closed. This means that the malicious app, i.e. the Adware, is working in the background.
2. **Frequent Lagging:** Lagging is a common problem in the Android phone, especially those with low configuration. But if it is frequently happening and for the more extended period, then certainly there is an Adware or any other malware infection on your phone.
3. **Unknown Apps**: If on your phone, you see any unknown apps that you don’t remember installing, it might be installed by the Adware or any other malware.
4. **Faster Battery Drain:** The most common sign of a malware attack on the smartphone is the sudden surge in the battery drainage. The malware like Adware hide in the background and silently conduct their malicious tasks, and in that process, they consume immense battery power.
5. **Increase in Data Usage:** Similar to battery drainage, an Adware infection can also cause a surge in internet data usage. While checking the data usage on the phone, if you find any suspicious app that was not supposed to use the internet but still consuming the unusual data, it might be the Adware.
6. **Overheating:** Overheating is expected when you use your Android phone extensively, like while playing games or watching videos. When an application is continuously operating in the background, then along with battery drainage, it will also cause the overheating. If you observe that your phone is overheating even though you aren’t using, it may be because of **Adware.**
7. **Random App Crash:** If apps crash randomly on your phone, it might be because the Adware application is consuming the RAM, denying other apps to run their services.
