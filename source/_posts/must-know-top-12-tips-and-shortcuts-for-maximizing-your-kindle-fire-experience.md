We all know that Kindle Fire is a good tablet, and there must be a large number of users are using this device, like me.

This guide lists **Top 10 Kindle Fire Cool Tricks** that you may want to know, for example, how to set wallpaper on kindle fire hd, what apps we must have for kindle fire, etc. And I'm sure they are helpful.

### Top 10 Cool Kindle Fire Tricks

Whether you are an honest Kindle Fire tablet user or a new owner, these cool kindle fire tricks listed in this guide will help you find more funny of this device. Some of them may be the "key" you are always searching for, and others may just play a role in broadening your eyes, but whatever the function is, these tutorials are worth reading.

Why I say Kindle Fire is a "special" Android? Yes kindle fire is an Android OS device, but Amazon put its own flavor on it, and we prefer to call it Fire OS, based on android 4.2.2\. It is unique in many ways from common android. It is unique, and particularly well-suited for certain kinds of users. You feel so good that you can enjoy amazon's special services, yes?

However, we should be aware that we lose something when we get something. We can enjoy amazon's special services, but the same time we lose some natural services of android. In other words, not all the things we could do on android can be also adopted to kindle fire. It's a pity, yes? What's worse, just because of the uniqueness, it's possible that one thing we do on android at ease may be unexpected too difficult on kindle fire. So?

So here I write this guide, bring you top 10 kindle fire cool tricks, for making your kindle fire a powerful tool.

Before deeply learning, it would be better if you could take a glance at these basics.

### Basic Getting Started Tricks for Kindle Fire

BatteryHere are some tips for you to save your Kindle Fire's battery power. Put your kindle fire to sleep mode when not in use; Lower the brightness when no need to full blast; Turn off Wifi when not using it; Exit an app when going to be away from device; Reboot kindle fire; Set screen to sleep mode. 

AppsAmazon Appstore gathered a large number of apps for us to use, but if you want to install apps from outside the Amazon Appstore, you can do it, just need to turn on "Allow the Installation of Applications from Unknown sources" lacated in Settings> Device. Besides, you can even install Google apps with rooting.

Books Kindle is famous for its books' services. We can purchase and download files to our kindle fire for reading. But kindle books can only be read on kindle devices and kindle apps. And in fact Kindl fire only supports books purchased from kindle store. You may have discovered that kindle put limitations on their books and devices, which makes users unable to read ebooks freely. If you have a collection of ebooks on your computer, or your other devices, then you want to read them freely on your Kindle fire, this tool [Ultimate eBook Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) is needed. Help you strip the limitations (DRM) and convert books to kindle supported format.
