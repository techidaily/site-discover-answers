What is Kindle Fire? Kindle Fire is a tablet designed by Amazon which was first released in November 2011\. The Kindle Fire is running a custom version of Android system with colored 7-inch IPS LCD touch screen. Later, the Amazon has updated its Kindle fire to Kindle fire HD and Kindle Fire HDX.

What is Kindle Paperwhite? The Kindle Paperwhite is the successor of the Amazon Kindle device which is an e-reader developed and marketed by Amazon. There is no doubt that Amazon Kindle is the most successful e-reader on the market which has even changed our reading experience. Among so many Amazon Kindle e-readers, the Kindle Paperwhite is the most popular and best-selling product.

Kindle Fire VS Kindle Paperwhite--which one should we get? Let's compare Kindle Fire and Kind Paperwhite to see which one you should buy. 

![kindle fire vs kindle paperwhite](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Kindle-fire-VS-Kinde-paperwhite-1.png)

###  Kindle Fire VS. Kindle Paperwhite

 In this part, I will compare Kindle Paperwhite 3 with Kindle Fire (5th generation) by features.

| |  **Kindle Fire** | **Kindle Paperwhite**                                                                                           |                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Screen**         | 7" touchscreen and backlit screen, 1024 x 600 resolution at 171 ppi, IPS technology, advanced polarizing filter | 6" with E Ink Carta and built-in light, 300 ppi, optimized font technology, 16-level gray scale |

Kindle fire has a bigger screen than Kindle Paperwhite, but the resolution is a little bit lower. 

They both have lights, but Kindle fire's light comes from the back of the image and the paperwhite's light from the front. If you read on Kindle Fire, it likes that you stare at the flashlight. Long time reading on fire will strain your eyes. Furthermore, you can not read on Kindle Fire directly under the sunlight. In the contrast, you eyes won't feel uncomfortable after reading a book on Kindle Paperwhite. 

Kindle Fire screen is colored which enables you to read the colored manga, but Kindle paperwhite can not because of the black and white screen. 

| |  **Kindle Fire** | **Kindle Paperwhite**                                                             |                                                                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Battery**        | Up to 7 hours of reading, surfing the web, watching video, and listening to music | A single charge lasts up to six weeks, based on a half hour of reading per day |

As we can see from above you can read long time with Kindle Paperwhite, but less time with Kindle Fire. If you play games or watch movies on Kindle Fire, the battery will drain much faster. Please ask yourself do you want to charge your Kindle device everyday.

| |  **Kindle Fire** | **Kindle Paperwhite** |           |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| **Weight**         | 313 grams             | 205 grams |

It is obvious that the Kindle Paperwhite is lighter than Kindle Fire. The lighter weight means the Kindle Paperwhite is much easier to hold. This is a big advantage for reading eBooks.

| |  **Kindle Fire** | **Kindle Paperwhite**                                                                                                               |     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **Storage**        | 8 GB (4.5 GB available to user) or 16 GB (11.6 GB available to user) of internal storage plus adding microSD card for up to 200 GB? | 4GB |

The Kindle Fire's storage is much larger than Kindle Paperwhite. But for storing Ebooks, 4GB means a thousand of eBooks which can be a big personal library. But only two or three downloaded movies will be out of the Kindle Fire's storage. Thus, I do not think the storage is an important concern.

| |  **Kindle Fire** | **Kindle Paperwhite**                     |                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Audio**          | 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated speaker | No audio function |

As audiobooks are more and more popular, people prefer to listening to audio books rather than reading ebooks. With Kindle Fire, you can listen to audiobooks as well as try the Amazon immersion reading feature which allows you to switch back and forth of reading and listening.

| |  **Kindle Fire** | **Kindle Paperwhite**    |                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Apps**           | Allow many kinds of Apps | Do not have this function |

Since the system of Kindle Fire is based on Android system, you can install many apps on it, such as chat apps, games, music and so on which you can get from the Google Play. With these apps, you can chat with your friends, listen to the music, or watch movies. The most important thing is that you can install other reader apps beyond Kindle for Android app, which can allow you to read .epub or .pdf books on Kindle Fire. You will never read epub books on Kindle Paperwhite unless you jailbreak your Kindle Paperwhite. 

However, if you are easily distracted by the gaming feature of the Kindle Fire, reading on Kindle Fire is not a good choice. 

| |  **Kindle Fire** | **Kindle Paperwhite** |         |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------- |
| **Price**          | 49.99$                | 119.99$ |

 As we can see the price of the Kindle Paperwhite is much higher than Kindle Fire. It's time for you to consider your budget. How much do you want to spend on this device? 

### Conclusion

Although we have listed so many differences between Kindle Fire and Kindle Paperwhite, you may still be confused and do not know which one to choose. Ok, I will list some questions. When you have finished these questions, you will know clearly which one to get.

| |  **Questions** | **Your Answer**                               |                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**            | Do you already have other tablet?             | Yes--Kindle Paperwhite No-Keep reading the following questions                           |
| **2**            | What's your main purpose to buy the device?   | Reading--Kindle Paperwhite More than reading(games, comics, movies, audios)--Kindle Fire |
| **3**            | How long do you read every day?               | More than 1 hour--Kindle Paperwhite Less than 1 hour--Kindle Fire                        |
| **4**            | How much do you want to spend on this device? | 50$--Kindle Fire No limitation--Kindle Paperwhite                                        |

I think people who are reading this article now are really eBook lovers. So the reading experience is the most important thing you are concerned. As a matter of fact, Kindle Paperwhite gives me much better reading experience. You will have the feeling that you are reading a real book. It will never strain your eyes. We know that Kindle Paperwhite does not have so many functions as Kindle Fire. Thanks to the less function, I can concentrate on reading books without being distracted by messages, games, emails and so on.

Now I am sure that you have made the decision. If you are still confused, and want to know more about these two Amazon products, please just let us know in the comment.

Sure, you can use it to access your library book. But you should use another device to download this book at first and then sent to kindle. If you purchase the Kobo Aura One, you can download the Library book directly as it has the built-in OverDrvive.

Kindle paperwhite 3 is the best sellers of all Kindles. As for Kindle paperwhite 4, it is waterproof and more expensive. Compared with Kindle paperwhite 3, kindle paperwhite 4 doesn't have so many important upgrades.

Thank you! This article was very informative to tell me which Kindle I would want to get. I have been having some serious problems with my eyes because I use a computer for most of my work day then usually come home and read on my iPad. So I thought maybe a Kindle instead could help. But I didn’t know which one to get. Even the list of questions just really helped solidify my choice (Paperwhite), and I cannot thank you enough for explaining so well!

The biggest benefit of Kindle fire over Kindle Paperwhite is seen when your read colorful magazines like NationalGeogrraphic,Pop Sci,Pop Mechanics,Vogue etc .Kindle fire let you have a real colorful magazine reading ,which is a treat.But Kindle Paperwhite won't.So between these two option is that a short duration reading without magazines and mostly book readings-go for Paperwhite.Otherwise go for fire.

My 2 yr old Kindle Fire won’t charge properly. Sometimes when I plug in the charger, it drains down to zero. Then it won’t do anything. I keep fooling around with it and eventually it charges. I’m ready to buy a new one. Is the Paperwhite better in this regard?
