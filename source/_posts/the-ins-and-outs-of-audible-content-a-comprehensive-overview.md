Audible is an Amazon company, home of the world's largest selection of audiobooks, audio shows, and original series. Audible's content includes more than 200,000 audio programs from leading audiobook publishers, broadcasters, entertainers, magazine and newspaper publishers and business information providers. And now Amazon Prime and Audible members also have access to Audible Channels, offering unlimited listening to original series and handcrafted playlists for every interest.

### 1\. What are the Formats of Audible Files

**Update**: Audible now exclusively provides AAX and AAXC formats for user downloads. And with a growing number of audiobooks lacking a download option, it's increasingly crucial to [back up your Audible library](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Audible Audiobooks are distributed by Audible with the file extensions .aa and .aax. They contain data encoded with either the MP3 or ACELP codes, but include a Digital Rights Management system requiring an Audible username and password of playback of the files. AAX format is [Enhanced Format](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/), While AA contains Format 2, Format 3 and Format 4\. Below picture is the difference between AA and AAX format. 

![audible formats](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-formats.png)

However, in order to provide you with the absolute best audio quality on the market, Audible.com has made all of our audiobooks available in both Format 4 and Enhanced Format. Choosing which format to download your audiobooks in comes down to how you plan to listen to them. Audiobooks in Enhanced format aren't compressed so they may take up a lot of space on your computer or phone. Audiobooks in Format 4 are compressed (much smaller), which is great if you want to download the audiobook and put it on your MP3 player.

And the default download format of an Audible file is an enhanced format(AAX). If you want to change your default download format: 

1\. Go to your library page on the Audible site.

2\. Click the drop-down menu at the top next to **Audio Quality**.

3\. Switch to whichever format you think will work for you.

By the way, on June 20, 2019, Audible released a new Audible App for Android/iOS. The biggest change coming to this version is that all Audible books downloaded through the Audible app will be saved in AAXC format instead of AAX/AA format. Don’t panic, the workaround for AAXC files is to download Audible books from Audible website or Audible App for Windows instead in order to convert Audible to MP3.

### 2\. How to Listen to Audible Files

The best way to listen wherever you go is to [download the Audible app](https://www.audible.com/ep/howtolisten). And the Audible app is free and available on iOS, Android, and Fire tablets. Be sure to keep it up-to-date to get the latest features.

The easiest way tp to play Audible books is by streaming Audible on the web through your Windows or Mac computer.

the converter works great BUT when the book is broken down by chapters and loaded onto my KLANGTOP CLIP or AGPTEK CLIP mp3 players, the CHAPTERS LOAD OUT OF ORDER. so i have to stop running or driving and manually shuffle through the jumbled chapters to select the next one. i tried manually loading the chapters onto the players, one by one, in order, yet they ended up jumbled. i tried renaming the chapters before loading---same result. when i talked with a support tech from the company, she told me that the program did what it was supposed to do---convert files---not present the converted files in order. BUYER BEWARE :)

Hello, I just received a message from Audible saying that format 4 downloading will no longer be supported (for Windows) and that they are moving to an enhanced high-quality format. However, there are two Audible enhanced formats: AAX (already available for downloading in Windows) and AAXC (currently, only available for Android). Do you know if they are moving to AAXC also for Windows? In that case, could Epubor still be used?

Thank you for asking.  
 The enhanced format to be released on 30 June 2020 can be AAX format, AAXC format or another new format. AAX and AA format can still be converted to MP3 with Epubor Audible Converter:  
 https://www.epubor.com/audible-converter.html

 However, if Audible end up only supporting AAXC format, there will be no tool that can deal with AAXC format. We will try our best to study on this project, but here now we cannot promise you when we will support the AAXC format.

 Therefore, before Audible finally make the switch, it’s highly recommended backing up your Audible books immediately. If you don’t know how to effectively back up Audible, here is a detailed introduction you can refer to:
